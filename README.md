## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned about **vertical rhythm** and it's importance in typography. I also learned about and used `clamp()` function to create fluid type system that is responsive to screen sizes.

### Continued development

I would want a better way to implement vertical rhythm in future challenges. Also, would to leverage custom properties for fluid type system.

### Useful resources

- [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/) - One of the best tools to create fluid type and space systems.
- [min-max calculator](https://min-max-calculator.9elements.com/) - Much simpler version of Utopia for single interpolated values between two endpoints.
